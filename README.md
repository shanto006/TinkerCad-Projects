Tinkercad Real-Life Arduino Projects
A hands-on repository of Arduino-based projects completed from a YouTube Tinkercad playlist, demonstrating practical and real-world applications. These beginner-to-intermediate projects use Tinkercad Circuits to simulate devices and systems commonly found in automation, security, home systems, and more — all without needing physical hardware.

🎯 Why This Repo?
This collection was created while following a structured playlist to strengthen embedded systems concepts using Tinkercad. Every project here is more than a simulation — it mimics real-life tools and technologies that you can build upon in your own electronics journey.

🔧 Features
1. 🧪 Tinkercad Simulation Ready
Each project can be opened and run in Tinkercad Circuits, allowing testing and experimentation in the browser.

2. 📂 Project-Based Organization
Projects are organized clearly by folders with descriptive names, including all necessary code and notes.

3. 🌍 Real-Life Use Cases
Most projects are designed with real-world inspiration, including:

Security Systems (motion detectors, door alarms)

Smart Home Ideas (auto lights, temperature control)

Automation Tools (touchless hand sanitizers, light-sensitive systems)

Interactive Fun Projects (digital dice, mini games)

4. 🧠 Learning-Oriented
Great for students, hobbyists, or anyone learning:

Arduino programming fundamentals

Circuit design logic

Embedded system prototyping

Problem-solving with code and sensors

5. 💻 Code + Simulation
Each folder includes:

Arduino code

Quick overview and usage

Simulation screenshots and design notes (if available)

🛠 Tools Used
Tinkercad Circuits – for simulation and design

Arduino IDE – for editing and testing code locally

🚀 How to Use This Repo
Browse through the folders and pick a project you're interested in.

Open the simulation link (if provided) or recreate it in Tinkercad Circuits.

Load the code into Arduino IDE or the Tinkercad code editor.

Experiment, tweak, and learn!
